### Goal

This is contact form using PHP-Mailer library with gmail SMTP server. I coded this project to practice on my knowledge of HTML, CSS, jQuery, and PHP in a real project.

### Benefits

Here are some ideas to benefit from this project:

- Take this project as a task and try to make it, and if you could not do a specific section, see how I make it in the source code (use comments to reach this section).
- Extract a code of a specific section and use it in your project.
- Review source code to see how other people code their projects.
- Edit on this project after studying its code well, to know how to work in pair-programming with other people
- Upgrade this project, and add your own sections or pages

### Installation

Here are the guidelines to run this project on your localhost:

1. Download, then install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) web server
2. Download this project, then rename its directory to `contact-form`
3. Copy the `contact-form` directory to the `htdocs` directory which exists in XAMPP installation path
4. Start XAMPP control panel from your Desktop, then start `Apache` web server
5. Open your browser, and type `http://localhost/contact-form`, to open the application

### Configurations

Here are some configurations to do in the `index.php` file:

- Set the `$mail->Username` (line: 37) to your google email (ex: example@gmail.com). This email will be used to send messages from google
- Set the `$mail->Password` (line: 39) to your google password for previous email
- Set the `$mail->addAddress` (line: 46) to your google email, and your name. This email will be used to receive messages

> In the `$mail->Username`, you should add a google email which allow the **Less Secure App Access**, otherwise the message will not be sent with this email. You can manage this from google email security settings
